<h2>Score Analysis</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<div>
<p>After the midterm exam, TAs want to analyze the number of students lying in different intervals. An interval is denoted as <code>[B, A]</code>, TAs want to find out the number of students whose score is <strong>lower than </strong><code>B</code> (<code>score &lt; B</code>) , the number of students whose score is <strong>grater than or equal to </strong><code>B</code><strong> but lower than </strong><code>A</code> (<code>B &lt;= score &lt; A</code>), and the number of students whose score is <strong>grater than or eqaul to </strong><code>A</code> (<code>score &gt;= A</code>).</p><p>Now, given the scores of each student, and different <code>[B, A]</code> intervals, please help TAs do the statistics.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line is an integer N (N < 1024), indicating the number of students.
The following N lines indicates the score of each student.
The next line is an integer T, indicating the number of different [B, A] intervals.
And the following T lines contain 2 integers, which indicates the value of B and A (B â‰¤ A).
<p></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
For each [B, A] interval, print out 3 interger, which represents the number of students whose score is lower than B (score < B) , the number of students whose score is grater than or equal to B but lower than A (B <= score < A), and the number of students whose score is grater than or eqaul to A (score >= A), respectively.
