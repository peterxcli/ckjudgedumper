<h2>MT - Matrix multiplication</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<div>
Given two matrices A, B with size n by m and m by p respectively, where
        _              _             _              _
       | a11 a12 .. a1m |           | b11 b12 .. b1p |
An_m = | a21 a22 .. a2m |    Bm_p = | b21 b22 .. b2p |
       |  .           . |           |  .           . |
       |_an1 an2 .. anm_|           |_bm1 bm2 .. bmp_|

The result of multiplication of A and B is a matrix with size n by p, where each element
ab_ij = sum(k = 1, m, a_ik*b_kj) for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n and 1 &lt;= j &lt;= p
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line contains three integers representing n, m and p,
and is followed by n + m lines: the first n lines represent matrix A, and the other m lines are for matrix B.
(0 <= a_ij, b_ij <= 1000)
<p></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
n lines with p elements in each line, representing the result of multiplication of A and B.
